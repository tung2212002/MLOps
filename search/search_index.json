The pipeline ensures smooth transitions between each phase of the workflow, reducing manual intervention and increasing efficiency. Experiment Tracking : With MLflow , all experiments are tracked and managed, including model training runs, hyperparameters, and performance metrics. This allows for easy comparison of different models and ensures reproducibility across experiments. Data Versioning : DVC (Data Version Control) is used to track data versions and ensure reproducibility. It integrates with cloud storage (like AWS S3) for efficient data management, even when datasets are large and constantly evolving. API Serving : FastAPI is used for serving real-time predictions via an API. This makes it easy to expose the model as a web service for integration into other applications or client-facing systems. Containerization : The project is containerized using Docker , simplifying deployment and ensuring consistency across different environments, whether local, cloud, or production. Technologies Used This project utilizes the following technologies to streamline the MLOps workflow: Python : The primary programming language for model training, data processing, and API development. FastAPI : A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework used for building APIs. It serves as the interface for making real-time predictions with the model. MLflow : A platform to manage the machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment. It helps ensure models are reproducible and can be easily compared. DVC (Data Version Control) : A tool for managing versions of datasets, models, and other files. DVC integrates with cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) to store datasets and tracks changes to data and models. Docker : Used to containerize the entire application, including the model, code, and dependencies. This ensures consistent deployment across various environments (local, cloud, or production). Cloud Services (AWS) : For scalable storage (AWS S3), compute resources (EC2, EKS), and CI/CD infrastructure (via GitHub Actions ).
