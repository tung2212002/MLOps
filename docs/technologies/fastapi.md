# FastAPI

**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and provides automatic interactive API documentation.

In our MLOps pipeline, FastAPI is used for model deployment, allowing us to serve our machine learning models as web services for real-time predictions. It supports asynchronous operations, making it ideal for high-performance, low-latency applications like ours.

### Key Features:
- High performance: One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
- Easy to use: Intuitive interface for building APIs with minimal code.
- Automatic validation and serialization of inputs/outputs.
- Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc).

FastAPI plays a crucial role in exposing the model's prediction API for consumption by other services or clients.

### Example:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from prediction_model import generate_predictions

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/predict")
def predict(data: dict):
    return {"prediction": generate_predictions(data)}
