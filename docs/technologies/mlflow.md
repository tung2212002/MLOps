# MLflow

**MLflow** is an open-source platform to manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It helps with tracking experiments, packaging code, and deploying models.

In our system, MLflow is used to track experiments, log model metrics, and store model artifacts. This allows us to efficiently manage and monitor our models as they evolve over time.

### Key Features:
- **Experiment Tracking**: Logs metrics, parameters, and models for each experiment.
- **Model Management**: Supports storing and versioning machine learning models.
- **Model Deployment**: Facilitates model deployment using REST API or integration with other platforms.

We use MLflow to log hyperparameters, metrics, and the models during training. It also helps in comparing different versions of the model to select the best one for deployment.

### Example:
```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn

with mlflow.start_run():
    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
    
    # Log metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
